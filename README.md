# dotfiles

With my recent migration from OSX to Linux, I'm preserving my linux setup for now. If I decide to go all in, I'll delete my Linux configuration. Until that day comes, I'll maintain the two setups within the subdirectories of this repository. Drill into each for more information on how to get up and running.

## Installation

See the `README.md` file in the `./osx` or the `./linux` directory, as appropriate.
